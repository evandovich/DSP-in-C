# SpecTUMi

This program performs spike extraction from a data sample collected from an L band radar (24GHz mmWave Radar sensor). The signal is averaged and downsampled, and a window of the signal is analyse in the Frequency spectrum. The higher spikes are then collected together with their freqs. 
The data file used is not accompanied with this code. Users are encouraged to input their own data.
